##Explanation of Program: 
##This program generates a random number between
##1 and 100 and has the user guess the value.
##Every guess, the program tells the user if
##their guess is either too high, too low, or 
##correct. If the guess is too high or low, the
##program has the user try again. The program 
##also keeps track of how many times the user has
##guessed. If the user guesses the correct number,
##the program notifies them and tells them how many
#times they guessed. It then restarts the game with
#a new randomly generated variable.
